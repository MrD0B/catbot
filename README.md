# catbot
client for chechire cat ai
It is a client that connects via the Websocket to the Cheshire Cat AI framework.
On the script.js file you have to change the pointing to the ip of your framework.
In my case I did not put port 1883 because I deleted it from the framework, if it is still present in yours it should be put in the string.
